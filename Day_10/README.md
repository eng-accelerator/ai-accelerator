- `location`: Location to search in (e.g., "San Francisco", "Remote")
- `company`: Company name to filter by
- `limit`: Maximum number of results (default: 10)

**Example:**
```python
search_jobs(keywords="python developer", location="San Francisco", limit=5)
```

### 2. `get_job_by_id(job_id)`
Get detailed information about a specific job by its ID.

**Parameters:**
- `job_id`: The unique ID of the job

**Example:**
```python
get_job_by_id(job_id=1)
```

### 3. `get_job_statistics()`
Get statistics about available jobs including:
- Total job count
- Remote job count
- Top locations
- Top companies

**Example:**
```python
get_job_statistics()
```

## Updating Job Data

To refresh the job database with new listings:

```bash
# Fetch new jobs from Adzuna API
uv run download_jobs_adzuna.py

# Load new data into database
uv run ingest_jobs_from_json.py
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
uv run test_job_search.py
```

## Customization

### Adding New Job Search Queries

Edit `download_jobs_adzuna.py` to modify the search queries:

```python
search_queries = [
    {"role": "Software Engineer", "location": "San Francisco", "num_results": 10},
    {"role": "Python Developer", "location": "New York", "num_results": 10},
    {"role": "React Developer", "location": "Remote", "num_results": 10},
    {"role": "Data Scientist", "location": "Seattle", "num_results": 10},
    {"role": "DevOps Engineer", "location": "Austin", "num_results": 10}
    # Add your custom searches here
]
```

### Modifying Database Schema

The job database schema is defined in `ingest_jobs_from_json.py`. You can add new fields by:

1. Modifying the SQL table creation query
2. Updating the data insertion logic
3. Adding new fields to the MCP tools in `main.py`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing environment variables" error:**
   - Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains valid Adzuna API credentials
   - Check that the file is in the same directory as `main.py`

2. **"No jobs found" error:**
   - Verify your Adzuna API credentials are correct
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try different search terms or locations

3. **Database connection issues:**
   - Ensure `jobs.db` file exists (run `ingest_jobs_from_json.py` first)
   - Check file permissions

4. **Permission errors on macOS:**
   - If you encounter permission errors, the project has been moved to `~/job_search_mcp`
   - Use the working directory: `cd ~/job_search_mcp`

### Getting Help

- Check the [MCP Python SDK documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- Visit [Adzuna API documentation](https://developer.adzuna.com/docs)
- Review the test output for debugging information
